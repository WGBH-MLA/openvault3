## intro

_The Big Dig: A Study in American infrastructure_ podcast draws from hundreds of audio and visual materials spanning over 40 years of GBH reporting. This special collection features a curated selection of clips used in the podcast series, as well as additional media from GBH programs like The Reporters, Byline, Ten O’Clock News, The Group, Greater Boston, and more.

These materials trace the long emotional arc of the Big Dig – from a longshot idea and historic undertaking, to a subject of scrutiny and outrage. We can see governor Michael Dukakis proposing the project to the public for the first time, backed by a row of maps and renderings. And we can see Mayor Tom Menino cutting the ribbon decades later, even as controversy swirls.
