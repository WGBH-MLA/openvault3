## intro

The [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/) contains approximately 40,000 hours of digitized television and radio programs selected by more than 100 public broadcasting stations throughout the nation. Nearly 12,000 programs are available for viewing and listening in the [AAPB Online Reading Room](http://americanarchive.org/). Dating from the 1940s to the 21st century, the AAPB collection includes national, local and regional programming. A collaboration between WGBH and the Library of Congress, the AAPB seeks to preserve and make accessible significant historical content created by public television and radio, and to preserve at-risk public media before its content is lost to posterity.
