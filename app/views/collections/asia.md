## Intro

The *Stories of East and Southeast Asia* collection consists of historical documentary series and programs produced by WGBH producers and independent filmmakers producing for public television.  The earliest programs were broadcast in 1970 but the bulk of the collection is from 1989 -2014.  These programs allowed American public television viewers - in many cases, for the first time - to explore historical events and see visual images of life in the countries of China, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Tibet. The collection includes a wealth of original interviews, outtakes, and archival footage.  


## Collection Summary

The *Stories of East and South East Asia* collection features three series which were produced between 1989-1998.   Most notably is WGBH/Ambrica Productions' six hour trilogy *China: A Century of Revolution*, which was the first US television special to explore China’s history between 1911-1949, as well as the tumultuous years under the rule of Mao Zedong (1949-1976), and the many changes that took place after his death (1976-1997). This unique series included never-before-seen images of Chinese leaders, as well as original interviews recounting stories of hope, progress, activism, atrocity and repression.   The series was completed in 2003 with *China in the Red* which aired as a *FRONTLINE* episode.   The collection also includes *Korea: The Unknown War*, a six hour series examining the origins and legacy of the Korean War which aired in 1990 and was produced by Thames Television. This was followed by *A Tug of War: The Story of Taiwan* which was a 90 minute documentary broadcast in 1998 which explored the forces which shaped Taiwan both past and present.    

The collection also includes many single episodes from WGBH series such as *NOVA*, *FRONTLINE*, *American Experience*, *Enterprise*, *The Course of Our Times*, *Basic Black*, and *Postcards from Buster*.  Two episodes from the 2014 series *Sacred Journeys with Bruce Feiler* which explore religious practices in Japan and India round out the collection. 



## Collection Background

Items in the *Stories of East and South East Asia* collection were digitized and cataloged with funding from the Asia Programs Endowment and National Endowment of the Humanities grants. Over 2,000 items were digitized and cataloged, including 16mm film prints, ¼” audio tapes, Hi 8, BetaSP, ¾”, 1” master, D3, Digibeta, HDCam, DVCPro, and MiniDV. The preservation project included not only the broadcast programs, but also raw interviews, b-roll footage, and archival films, many of which have never been seen before outside their countries of origin. 

GBH Archives seeks to both preserve and make these unique materials available to the public, bringing stories that are underrepresented in English-language media to new audiences.

Additional materials related to East and South East Asia that are not available in the Online Reading Room can be accessed on the premises of the Library of Congress and GBH.
