# Stories of East and South East Asia

16


## Collection Summary

Since the 1970’s, GBH has produced multiple programs and series on Asian history, peoples, and culture. When broadcast, these shows allowed US viewers - in many cases, for the first time - to explore historical events and life in the countries of China, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Tibet. The Stories of East Asia collection focuses specifically on the countries of Eastern and Southeastern Asia, and includes documentary programs along with a wealth of associated interviews, outtakes, and archival raw footage.

The collection features the WGBH/Ambrica Productions' six hour trilogy *China: A Century of Revolution*, the first US television special to explore China’s history between 1911-1949, as well as the tumultuous years under the rule of Mao Zedong (1949-1976), and the many changes that took place after his death (1976-1997). This documentary series includes never-before-seen images of Chinese leaders, as well as original interviews recounting stories of hope, progress, activism, atrocity and repression.  

The collection also includes *Korea: The Unknown War*, a six hour series examining the origins and legacy of the Korean War and A *Tug of War: The Story of Taiwan*.  Also included are single episodes from the WGBH series *NOVA*, *FRONTLINE*, *American Experience, Enterprise*, *The Course of Our Times*, *Basic Black*, *Postcards from Buster*, and *Sacred Journeys with Bruce Feiler*. 


## Collection Background

Items in the *Stories of East and South East Asia* collection were digitized and cataloged with funding from the Asia Programs Endowment and National Endowment of the Humanities grants. Over 2,000 items were digitized and cataloged, including 16mm film prints, ¼” audio tapes, Hi 8, BetaSP, ¾”, 1” master, D3, Digibeta, HDCam, DVCPro, and MiniDV. The preservation project included not only the broadcast programs, but also raw interviews, b-roll footage, and archival films, many of which have never been seen before outside their countries of origin. 

GBH Archives seeks to both preserve and make these unique materials available to the public, bringing stories that are underrepresented in English-language media to new audiences.

Additional materials related to East and South East Asia that are not available in the Online Reading Room can be accessed on the premises of the Library of Congress and GBH.
