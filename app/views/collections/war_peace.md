## intro

*War and Peace in the Nuclear Age*, first broadcast in 1989, is a thirteen-part 
PBS series on the origins and evolution of nuclear competition between the 
United States and the former Soviet Union. The series examined the rivalry for 
power and how it shaped the diplomacy, negotiation, ethical debates, and 
doctrine of deterrence that ran through the forty-year history of the nuclear 
age. This collection contains the full interviews and selected stock footage 
from the series.  If you would like to view the full *War and Peace in the 
Nuclear Age* episodes you may schedule an appointment at GBH in Boston by 
contacting the GBH Archives.
