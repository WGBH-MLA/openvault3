## intro

The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom featured an estimated 250,000 
peaceful demonstrators walking from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln 
Memorial to hear a political call to arms for economic equality and civil 
rights for African Americans. Credited with being the final impetus to the 
passing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the event famously ended with Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s historic “I have a dream” speech.
