Say Brother is WGBHâ€™s longest-running public affairs television program by, for 
and about African Americans, now known as Basic Black. In April 2000, the WGBH 
Media Library and Archives in Boston was awarded a National Endowment for the 
Humanities Archives and Special Collections Preservation and Access grant to 
arrange, describe, and reformat master Say Brother programs dating from 1968 to 
1982 to keep the collection accessible. WGBH welcomes you to explore this 
invaluable programming, whether performance, political commentary, or 
conversations with distinct voices from the African American community.
