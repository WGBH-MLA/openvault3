The New Television Workshop at WGBH supported the creation and broadcast of 
experimental works by artists from 1974 to 1993. The New Television Workshop 
Collection was preserved, arranged, and described by the WGBH Media Library and 
Archives with support from the National Endowment for the Arts (Grant # A 96 â€“ 
019016). Materials in the collection include videos from the New Television 
Workshop, as well as early video arts works that pre-dated organization of the 
New Television Workshop and ancillary but related video art works produced by 
WGBH.
