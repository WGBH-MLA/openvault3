## intro

This ten-part series explores the musical styles, influences, and complex 
creative processes that have allowed rock to endure, from its renegade 
beginnings in the 1950s to the 1990s. From performers to producers, songwriters 
to studio engineers, session musicians to disk jockeys, *Rock & Roll* is an 
extensively researched and revealing history built on stories from and about 
the innovators who defined the music that has rocked the nation and the world 
for 40 years. A co-production between WGBH/Boston and BBC, this collection 
contains interviews created for the series.
