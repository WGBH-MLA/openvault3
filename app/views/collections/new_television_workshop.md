## intro

The *New Television Workshop* at WGBH supported the creation and broadcast of 
experimental works by artists from 1974 to 1993. The *New Television Workshop* 
Collection was preserved, arranged, and described by the WGBH Media Library and 
Archives with support from the National Endowment for the Arts (Grant # A 96 â€“ 
019016). Materials in the collection include videos from the *New Television 
Workshop*, as well as early video arts works that pre-dated organization of the 
*New Television Workshop* and ancillary but related video art works produced by 
WGBH.
