## intro

The <em>Stonewall Uprising</em> Interviews Collection is comprised of 48 raw interviews from the <em>American Experience</em> documentary of the same name, directed by Kate Davis and David Heilbroner. The documentary discusses the Stonewall riots, a six-day period beginning on June 28, 1969, during which the LGBTQ+ community protested against a police raid on a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn, in Greenwich Village, NYC. <em>Stonewall Uprising</em> discusses societal attitudes towards the gay community and early activism for gay rights prior to the riots, as well as the riotsâ€™ legacy, which includes the creation of a movement for gay rights, greater cohesion among the LGBTQ+ community, and the establishment of the first gay pride parades. Interviews took place with community leaders, activists, and authors, including Martha Shelley, a Stonewall veteran, activist for gay and lesbian rights, and one of the first four members of the Gay Liberation Front; Ed Koch, former mayor of New York City; Virginia Apuzzo, a gay rights activist and former Executive Director of the National LGBTQ Task Force; Seymour Pine, Deputy Inspector of the NYPD Morals Division; and Dick Leitsch, an activist and the first gay reporter to write about the Stonewall riots. 

<em>American Experience</em>, PBS' flagship history documentary series, premiered in 1988 and is produced at GBH in Boston. In 2017, the GBH Archives digitized the <em>Stonewall Uprising</em> interviews and in 2018 submitted them to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.
