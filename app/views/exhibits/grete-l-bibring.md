## intro

Grete Lehner Bibring was born in Vienna on January 11, 1899. Inspired by 
Sigmund Freud's work in psychoanalysis, she became one of the very few female 
medical students at the University of Vienna in 1918, and one of the first 
psychiatrists to champion the need to incorporate psychoanalysis into the 
practice of medicine. She married a member of Freud's Vienna Psychoanalytic 
Society Edward Bibring in 1921. Leaving Austria after Nazi's takeover in 1938, 
they eventually settled in Boston in 1941, where Dr. Grete L. Bibring continued 
her medical career and became a chief of psychiatry at Boston Beth Israel 
Hospital and the first woman clinical professor at Harvard Medical School in 
1961. The Boston postwar period was fruitful for both psychiatry and 
psychoanalysis, with more medical students entering psychiatry and more 
psychiatrists seeking analytic training. A change in the acceptance of 
psychoanalysis took place during the war, partly as a result of experiences 
with psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric services were established in general 
hospitals, and federal funds and private foundations supported psychiatric 
training and psychosomatic research. Bibrings’ arrival in Boston coincided with 
a new era in American psychiatry and medicine. The ground had been prepared by 
psychoanalysts like William Healy at the Judge Baker, Ives Hendrick at Boston 
Psychopathic, and Stanley Cobb at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Grete 
Bibring served as a president of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and 
Institute from 1955 to 1958, president of the American Psychoanalytic 
Association in 1962, and vice president of the International Psycho-Analytical 
Association. In the early 1950’s, Grete Bibring initiated an important study of 
the psychological aspects of pregnancy at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. 
Two papers summarizing the results of the study were published in the 
*Psychoanalytic Study of the Child* in 1961 (Vol. 16, p. 9-72). One of her major 
contributions to psychiatry was creation of different personality types to 
guide medical management of each patient. According to numerous accounts of her 
students, she was a brilliant teacher interested in bringing psychoanalytic 
ideas into a general medical setting. After she became emerita in 1965, Dr. 
Bibring continued to teach a special seminar at the Radcliffe Institute on the 
development of professional women. Between 1928 and 1976, Dr. Bibring published 
over thirty papers, in both medical and psychoanalytic journals, and as 
chapters in books edited by others. She co-authored, with Dr. Ralph M. Kahana, 
*The Lectures in Medical Psychiatry* (1969) and edited the *The Teaching of 
Dynamic Psychiatry* (1968). Several of her publications were on general hospital 
psychiatry and an important paper was on normal aging "Old Age, Its Liabilities 
and Assets" (1966). In 1975, she participated in a WGBH documentary television 
program, *Psychoanalysis: A Personal View*, where she was interviewed by Dr. 
Oliver Cope, MD. She also gave a major address at MIT on "Freud and the 
Understanding of Human Nature." Grete L. Bibring died on August 10, 1977 in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

### Interview of Grete L. Bibring, M.D.
#### By Oliver Cope, M.D.
#### “Psychoanalysis: A Personal View”
#### WGBH, 1975

#### NARRATOR:
Dr. Bibring is an international figure in psychoanalysis.
She was a student and colleague of Sigmund Freud, the first
woman clinical professor at the Harvard Medical School and
Chief of the Psychiatric Service at Beth Israel Hospital in
Boston. She is past president of the American
Psychoanalytic Association.  Dr. Cope is Professor of
Surgery, Emeritus, at Harvard Medical School, and Senior
Consulting Surgeon of the Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston.  Today, Dr. Bibring and Dr. Cope will conduct an
informal interview about some of her experiences as a
psychoanalyst.

#### OLIVER COPE
Dr. Bibring, what an opportunity for me, a surgeon, to
come and ask you about psychoanalysis.  How come that you
went into Medicine?  1918.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Nineteen-eighteen.  Now, it’s hard for me to say
exactly why I chose Medicine, but I can try. You know, I
was in [     ] Gymnasium, eighteen years and we went in
that period over most areas eclectic, to be learned about,
so that [   ] anymore think about Greek and Latin, we went
into History and into Natural Sciences, Physics and
Mathematics, practically everything one could really
consider. So that means that eight years, from 10 to 18,
there came the opportunity to choose to decide.  And
finally I decided Medicine it is, and it stayed for good.

#### OLIVER COPE
So you went into Medicine—did you know you were going
to go into Psychiatry when you started in Medicine?  This
was just at the end of World War I.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Now, I heard about Freud two years before I went to
medical school.  In the gymnasium I was pretty young,
seventeen, and it was in the seventh grade in Psychology
class, and one of the students got up and told us that her
father, a physician in Vienna, had played cards with a
friend, Dr. Freud, every Saturday, and Freud told him and
the other men in the group that academic psychology figured
out some very important parts of what is going on psychologically in people and what motivates them, and what
influences their lives, though they are not aware of it.
And he called these factors unconscious factors.
Now, I was very curious, and on my way home I dropped in at [ ], who was then the publisher of Freud and asked for some of his writings, and he gave me Wit and Its Relationship to the Unconscious. I didn’t like it at all. It was confusing; it wasn’t even interesting but I didn’t give up. I went back and asked for another book. At that time, he gave me The Psychopathology of Everyday Life. Now, that was very different—thought provoking—it was very interesting.

#### OLIVER COPE
And you were still a gymnasium student.

#### MRS. BIBRING
In the seventh grade.  Two years later I was in
medical school, and I remember very well, I was sitting in
my Anatomy Lecture between two returned veterans of the
First World War, it had just ended. It was 1918. Their
names were Edward Bibring and Madame Reich. Both of them
became rather known in this country and abroad later on.
Now, a little note was passed around and on it was written
“Those colleagues who want to know more about certain
subjects which are not taught in medical school, or are not
taught well, should stay back after the lecture.”  Signed,
Otto Fenichel, also a man who became very known as a
leading psychoanalyst later on.

I told my two neighbors I was very interested in it.
This man is very good, I knew him from the time we played
in the sandbox together and somehow he always stayed there.
Then there was another student who wanted to become an
endocrinologist and somebody wanted to go into internal
medicine.  And we set up a seminar-a new seminar-to study
these things.

Just you students?

It was all five.

#### OLIVER COPE
Bibring, and Fenichel, and you.

#### MRS. BIBRING
No, and two others, which, they got lost and then one
went to endocrinology and one into internal medicine.  Now,
we set up a seminar and used them not to bring the books
and we started with very conservative things, with
textbooks on endocrinology, and then we read [Friese?], who
was a close friend of Freud but didn’t know about that, who had the most interesting idea about human physiology-not a
correct one, but interesting.

Then, I think, we read Havelock Ellis’s The Psychology of Sex. And then we had an assignment to report Freud’s contribution to the theory of sex, and the student who had to review it, was Edward Bibring. Now, he came back to our seminar, and he said, “Most interesting, and most important book.” And I piped up and I really got quite embarrassed about this remark the older I got and then I got old enough not to be embarrassed but amused and touched by this very famous man, and a very great man. I read some of his writings. Now, you mustn’t forget, I was a youngster of seventeen.  I’d read two books, whereas these men who were
[   ] me as my elders, were in the war, [    ] another war
in Russia and I was in the luxury of literature and science
and could do whatever fed my  . . 
.
#### OLIVER COPE
And nineteen at the time.

#### MRS. BIBRING
That’s right.  So, nobody handed it in for a mark. And
we went on, and we were working very hard on it, setting up
more and more of these studies, which was later on when we
became psychoanalysts, called “The Seminar of the Children”.  We were the children at that time.  So this is
how I got into it.

#### OLIVER COPE
When did you first meet Freud?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I think at that time already, not only Freud but the
other analysts, too, what we did, and maybe there were
additional men, I don’t know, whether it still exists,
every doctor had office hours set aside, one or two hours
in the afternoon, and you could come to them without a
carefully arranged appointment.  So we went to analysts
whose books we’d read, including Freud, and asked him
simply, “What does that mean?”  “What does he advise we
should read after it?” And sometimes we simply debated.
And you know, it was in the 1920s, early, there was no
Institute in Vienna.

#### OLIVER COPE
Was this characteristic of the student body? Were
there other groups like yours doing, in a sense, original,
investigated on your own?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I don’t know.  I think they’re all like that. I remember
 concentrating on what were they doing.  For instance . . .

#### OLIVER COPE
Of course, this wasn’t outlined for you. You had no
professor and no course telling you to do this. This was
your own initiative.

#### MRS. BIBRING
There was no Institute; we were not spoiled with a
theme and programs. We found it quite in order to let in
four students that were Stanton [?], Reich, the two people
but were married to each other, to be invited by Freud to
be guests and definitely not psychoanalysts, but some of
them eventually became.  And this is how we met him and
this is how our professional lives started.

#### OLIVER COPE
When was the Institute founded? Or was there never a
psychoanalytic institute . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
 think, you know, if I had known what you’d ask, I
would have asked and whatever, looked it up.  But I think
it was about 1926. Helene Deutsch, who had her clinic in
Berlin, would come back to us and told us about an
institute in Berlin and how it functioned, and we thought
we should have an institute.  So we established an
institute, making Helene Deutsch the first chairman of the
Education Committee; and then we did something very improper. We felt we had no credentials, no formal credentials, so we thought we should have certificates for us. We have a young faculty, never trained but by ourselves, and we really printed certificates, and five of them were issued, signed by Freud and I. [?] Gottschalk and then we all found that this was improper. We discarded all the other certificates. Nobody else got them. Because that is not right. But these five or six [ ], my comrades andIwere[ ]

#### OLIVER COPE
The Institute therefore was not in any sense formally
a part of the university?

#### MRS. BIBRING
No.
#### OLIVER COPE
Did the university recognize what was going on?

#### MRS. BIBRING
There was a lot of fight against, aversion against
Freud, psychoanalysis.

#### OLIVER COPE
Was he kept out of the local medical society?

#### MRS. BIBRING
Yes. I tell you, we had a great scandal when we first
reported the theory of hysteria, and then the sex problem came up, and it was a real scandal in the medical society.
This was really why he could never progress in his career
as far as the university was concerned. We all were really
somehow looked upon as a little bit outcast. The funny
thing is, that my love was Anatomy. It was so clean and so
clear and so informative, and I really slowly got more and
more into medicine but I had this [    ] to [  ].

#### OLIVER COPE
But Freud started as an anatomic neurologist, also
studying anatomy in detail.  Neural anatomy.

#### MRS. BIBRING
But in the last two years of my medical school, Dr.
Cope, I matriculated in Philosophy, too. You know, we were
not quite as natural scientists as you very often are when
you go into Medicine. We were feminists.

#### OLIVER COPE
There was not at that time a prescribed course?

#### MRS. BIBRING
Yes, in Medicine, yes. But we didn’t keep to it
completely, we’d go apart from it but found it important
and interesting.

[Coffee is served. Brief chitchat back and fourth about whether to take sugar and is the coffee okay, etc.]

#### OLIVER COPE
You became a member—you were a member of the
Institute, and then along came Hitler, and the Institute
disbanded, or couldn’t work under Hitler’s time?

#### MRS. BIBRING
First of all, the Institute disbanded because it was
complicated, but there was a small core of underground
analysts who stayed in Vienna. Now, let me try to tell you
how this thing developed. We all stayed for all kinds of
reasons—responsibilities, or work, or loyalties—we all
knew that it would come. We weren’t naïve.

#### OLIVER COPE
Because there were Jews among the analysts, but also
because of the process, the actual analytic processes which
would be devastating to any political body that was trying
to, well, to . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Sure.  But, you know, we had occasion—1936, already—
to go to Detroit, to set up an institute, and we felt we
couldn’t do that.  You know, you couldn’t just run away. So
we stayed.  And I remember, the second my husband would
even run, and keep everything. But we run with a light
heart. That was the test. So it was breaking the heart,
too.

Now, I can’t vouch for Freud’s motives but he was 82
and probably didn’t want to be uprooted, and probably
hoped, from what he said sometimes, that to stay there
might protect the Institute, the publishing house, the
documents.  He was completely wrong.  So, come to Vienna.
Don’t.

#### OLIVER COPE
From London?  Ernest Jones.

#### MRS. BIBRING
From London.  He persuaded Freud to come to London.
Freud insisted that he would go only when some of his
editors would also go.  So Jones promised the coming
emigration be done.

#### OLIVER COPE
Jones had been a student, years earlier?  Now, this is
1938, that Jones came? But Jones was not a contact man.  As
a psychiatrist, he had been a student in the ‘20s with
Freud?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I don’t know exactly when.  But he was very active for
a long time in the United States, and [he continues],
really, to a certain extent. And Putnam . . .
11
#### OLIVER COPE
But Putnam was a part of the Symposium at Worcester,
at Clark University that was organized by the then
president of Clark. But Freud somehow didn’t like the
United States.

#### MRS. BIBRING
No, he didn’t.  I remember once, even I remember, it
wasn’t against American people personally. It was against
something which wasn’t so wrong, this kind of, what he felt
its business bent, and the fear that the Nazis would become
part of it for a certain period and . . .

#### OLIVER COPE
And it almost did.  And he could sense that in
American medicine. Wasn’t it 1910 that he came to
Worcester? 1910-1920.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Nineteen nine.

#### OLIVER COPE
And somehow he was cut off.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I remember once this little anecdote. We had a meeting
in his house and he came in with a letter.  He was a very
written man, with a letter, and showed us the letter, the
appearance of the letter.  And there was a slit and the tiny things were slipped into it. The letter was asking the
famous professor to send his signature to under, whatever
the signed, and to put in ten cents for the stamps.

#### OLIVER COPE
For the postage.

#### MRS. BIBRING
So somehow it’s part of something that he didn’t like.
But I think he was . . .

#### OLIVER COPE
You’re saying, ‘engrossed’ in what he was doing.  That
he didn’t . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
That’s right. He was afraid that he would miss
something between—just before the marketplace, at least he
didn’t study the marketplace, but it doesn’t function well
in the marketplace.

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes. We must come back to your own experience when you
reached this country, because we still, as a country, at
least in the medical profession, are quite suspicious of
psychoanalysis, really, aren’t we?  He must have sensed
that somehow.

But first now, you were in Vienna and then you were
invited to Detroit, but in 1936.

#### MRS. BIBRING
We didn’t go.  [       ]  come in winter. You know, I
still can’t ... it’s in ... because it is singular.

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, there were two of you, so you had two visas.

#### MRS. BIBRING
We had a common visa. Okay, however, and the
interesting thing was . . .

#### OLIVER COPE
I think our audience ought to know something about
your Latin. You told me some time ago that when you were in
medical school, the professors still, when they were
talking about the disease before the patient, is that they
talked in Latin.  That was, theoretically, so that the
patient wouldn’t be worried about what you were talking
about.  Well, you had to be conversant, fluent in Latin as
a medical student.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Well, eighteen years, every day, for an hour.

#### OLIVER COPE
So we understand why you don’t like us to talk about
visas.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Exactly. Exactly.

#### OLIVER COPE
All right.  That’s an extraordinary cultural
difference, because American medicine never had this
cultural inhibition, if you will.

#### MRS. BIBRING
No, I understand. I understand and can remember, once
we were on a curriculum, outside of—what was this place?
Not Endicott House?

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes, Endicott House.
#### MRS. BIBRING
And I wrote in Greek. [         ], because the whole
group talked about natural sciences and medicine, and
nobody cared for the [psyche?]. And they said something
very drastic. I had to go upstairs to take my seat, and I
heard Dr. Cope say in this particular facetious way of his,
he said: “Dr. Bibring had the audacity to write something
here on the table which nobody in the house understands
what it means.”

#### OLIVER COPE
[Laughs]. Well, I, I’m afraid . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Now, okay, what was your question?

#### OLVIER COPE
Well, I wanted to get you to Boston. You were invited
to Detroit in 1936, but for various reasons you felt this
was not wise, but when Jones . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Wise, but not proper.

#### OLIVER COPE
Because you would be coming alone and forsaking . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Well, you know, there is something to that.

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes, and so you stayed, and then when Jones came with
the home office from England inviting Freud and you as a
group . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Some of his editors.

#### OLIVER COPE
His editors.

#### MRS. BIBRING
And now, my husband was one of them.  And all these
editors, interestingly enough, were married to
psychoanalytic ladies. So they were couples.

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, sort of an ‘in-group’, you might say.  At any
rate, as a body, you went to England.  Then in London you
joined a group of psychiatrists or analysts who were
already practicing analytic type, and then came war.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Yeah. One year, the work was beautiful. Then came the
war.  Freud died in ’39. The publishing house was bombed.
Most of the—not most but a large percentage of the British
psychoanalysts—at least in the break—evacuated
themselves.

#### OLIVER COPE
Your two boys, when the war came, your two boys were
evacuated to the country but you and Dr. Edward Bibring had
to stay, for professional reasons, in London.

#### MRS. BIBRING
That’s right, and that was really what bothered me
most. They were so serious when the break started. But we really expected that our boys might not see her over the weekend anymore. And then the German invasion was threatened. So [Grovalt?] offered, seriously, that if something happened to us, he would adopt the children. Now, a woman colleague of ours, Minnie Hoffer [?], who had died in the meantime, became an air raid warden, and every
morning we went around, either by telephone or personally, to friends to see whether they are still there. This was the situation and then one day, an invitation for my husband to come to Tufts Medical School. Warren Stearns had invited him with an appointment.

#### OLIVER COPE
Dr. Stearns, who was Professor of Neurology at Tufts
Medical School at that time. Now, your good husband was
attached to Tufts.  How did you become attached to Harvard?
You came in 1942.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Forty-one.

#### OLIVER COPE
Forty-one. Now, I think our audience ought to know,
that although there had been one woman, Dr. Alice Hamilton,
who was a professor of Industrial Medicine in the Public
Health School, you are the first woman to have been
appointed a professor of Medicine, professor of Psychiatry
at the Harvard Medical School.  Now, how did that happen?

#### MRS. BIBRING
Circumstances at that time, partly.  You know, when we
came, we had a number of friends here, former students,
colleagues.  It was delightful to come to Boston and
suddenly to discover how many of our friends were here, and
they told us, introduced us into their many ways of life.
Now, the interesting thing was that they told us, here in
the United States, a doctor gives some service to the
hospital. Now, that wasn’t our habit. What we did, we had
our own psychoanalytic outpatient clinic which we supported
ourselves. It was very interesting and we were told that
the Beth Israel Hospital, which is a first-rate hospital,
has an outpatient—that that outpatient wing which is
almost exclusively occupied by psychoanalysts in Boston.
Now, we were in the outpatient clinic during the war.  And
so many of our colleagues had to go into service, and
somehow they appointed me as the Acting Head of the
Outpatient Clinic.

Now, in the health offices, where interns and
residents, [       ] because they had so little teaching,
all the big names, they’re gone.  So they now came to me
and said that I will teach them how my specialty fits into
Medicine. So I was very glad to do so.  Now, this was
something which I didn’t expect to turn out so beautifully.
I taught them but the only hour read was from 1:00 to 2:00.
Now, they all came and sat down, and half of them fell
asleep, because it was after lunch and they were so
overworked. So I talked to the other half, and I was
sympathetic with them. The next time, the other half was asleep, and some of them were awake, so I acquired the
habit of summarizing what I had done the time before.  Now,
this they never, never forgot.  They really became a
favorite of theirs, apart from the fact that I think the
lectures were really interesting.  It’s quite excited over
it.

So when Dr. Blumguard became the new Physician in
Chief, returning from India after the war, he brought with
him some observation, that most of the soldiers, apart from
their physical illnesses, had severe psychological
disturbances.  He had this genius idea that psychiatry
really belongs into a general hospital.

#### OLIVER COPE
That was not until ’48, then.

#### MRS. BIBRING
It was ’46.

#### OLIVER COPE
Forty-six, oh yes, because his war service in part had
been in India.

#### MRS. BIBRING
And I said “No.” You know, I wanted to go back. I told
him, I said, I don’t know enough about American hospitals.
I have never run a department. I can’t push people around
if I know less than they do. And he said so, constantly, he
repeated it, “It’s all for the better.” And finally he said
something which stopped me in my flight. He said, “You
know, this is the way you psychoanalysts always are. When
we try to do something psychological with our sick
patients, you look down your noses, and you say it’s all
wrong. And we say, ‘Come and help us.’ You say, ‘Sorry, I’m
too busy.’” And I knew he was right! And it bothered me.
And I also admired this exact, wonderful, psychological
gimmick he had, to hit me where I’m vulnerable.  You know,
years later, it turned out that it wasn’t a gimmick. He
really meant what he said.

#### OLIVER COPE
It was an extraordinary thing, and I don’t know that
you can really evaluate today what you contributed at that
time.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I hope I contributed something.

#### OLVIER COPE
Well, of course you did. And it was an extraordinary
awakening. I have to say it is an awakening because brought up here as a medical student in the ‘20s, then as a young doctor in the ‘30s, we were really—the profession was anti-psychiatric, and anti-women. You know that story about ...


#### MRS. BIBRING
No I don’t.

#### OLIVER POPE
You know that when the war came, as the war approached
in 1941 just at the time you arrived, there was a thought
that maybe Harvard Medical School should admit women. And
then the war broke, President Conant felt it clear that it
should be considered and he appointed a faculty committee.
I had the opportunity of being the youngest member of a
committee of six. The chairman of it was the older
professor of pathology, Dr. Wolbach. And the meetings of
the committee consisted really of finding out how many
women were actually in practice who had graduated, and they
were in a respectable number. And so, he felt that, five of
six of the committee felt, it was quite clear that women
should be admitted to the Harvard Medical School and Dr.
Wolbach felt it was an emotional attitude, and we came to
the faculty meeting, really unprepared to meet specific
objections or points. At any rate, the committee proposed
to the university and to the faculty, that women be
admitted.

Early 1942, just after you arrived. And there were
twelve opponents, and there were double the number,
approximately 24 who were for it—of course, including Dr.
Blumguard and the Dean, who was a very considerate,
thoughtful, mild-mannered man, and Dr. Wislocki, whose wife
was a doctor and there were many strong voices for the
admission of women.

The senior surgeon of the time, who was the anatomist,
by the way—the surgical anatomist—said he was sorry;
women had no place as doctors because everybody knows that
in the animal kingdom the intelligence of an animal is
directly proportional to the weight of the brain. Rats, all
the way up to monkeys, and then human beings. And there was
no dispute about that. Women’s brains . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Are smaller.

#### OLIVER COPE
. . .  are a hundred grams smaller than men’s;
therefore, it’s perfectly clear that women are not as
intelligent as men.

#### MRS. BIBRING
And they believed him?

#### OLIVER COPE
No. No, they fought over it. He, poor man, got very
angry and had almost a disastrous hemorrhage the next day.
He had an ulcer and he nearly bled to death. But there was
an interesting alignment in the faculty: the twelve voices
23
against it were all professors of surgery. But we didn’t
have sense enough to ask, I should have asked those who
were against it, had they really looked at the number of
cells in the brain. After all, the capacity of the brain
must depend not upon its weight but upon its number of
cells, and after all, women’s hands are smaller, their feet
are smaller, they’re just as good hands to use as ours, and
why isn’t your brain just as good? It might have more cells
actually because it has more to do in the physiologic sense
than man’s.

But at any rate, there was an awakening which was
coming just at the time to which you unquestionably
contributed at the Beth Israel. There’s no doubt that those
students, those house officers as you have—

#### MRS. BIBRING
It’s an interesting thing, you know.

#### OLIVER COPE
It’s as if the man’s eyes were opened to what women
might contribute. And so you were properly honored by being
made the first woman professor.

Though there are a lot of things now that we need to
know. Am I right that our profession doubts, really, the
usefulness of psychoanalytical medicine as compared to so-
called straight psychiatry? Is that true; do you feel it?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I don’t think so. I don’t think that they—what do you
call our profession—the psychiatrists?

#### OLIVER COPE
No, I’m talking about medicine in general. Internists,
orthopedists, surgeons . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
I don’t think that they believe in psychiatry either.
You know, it’s a very difficult field. Even if they accept
it, the proper, the house-broken psychiatry, has very
little to offer. Now you know what we go through with shock
and medication and surgery—brain surgery.

#### OLIVER COPE
But why is it that the medical profession in general
finds it hard to accommodate analytic psychiatry in its
view of medicine?

#### MRS. BIBRING
Because the doctors think they are closest to God. And
they know everything, and they are always against new
ideas, which they hadn’t applied themselves. You have to
think of Semmelweis; you have to think of Mesmer, of Freud;
that is, they are all from the orthodox group. And they
understand, you know, they have to know and they have
really that life, the responsibility for the life of people
it makes them.  More reach it, number one. Number two, it’s
a field for which you have to be gifted. It isn’t something
which you can just learn by rote. You have to have a
feeling for people. This is not so good, you know, that’s
not scientific. And then they anecdote the thing, etcetera.

And I’ll tell you one thing which has always impressed
me. People just don’t know what analysis is. They know
people who taught it, applied it in their fields, in their
daily language and have no idea what it really represents.
And they attack it.  Even scientists. Scientists really
write against it and use it and are not aware of it.

#### OLIBER COPE
Could you give us an example of . . . we quoted—you
pointed out that we quote analytic psychiatry, Freudian
psychiatry, in our everyday language. It’s become part of
our accepted language.

#### MRS. BIBRING
But it’s always misunderstood!

#### OLIVER COPE
Give us an example of a misunderstood quote.
#### MRS. BIBRING
#### For instance, it’s not any more since we are not
certified any longer, but you could come to a cocktail
party and clearly somebody telling a dream to somebody else and the somebody else said, “Ohhh, you wanted to kill your
wife?” No, they didn’t even know that the top thing has
nothing to do with what is underneath. You know, at least
they understood a little bit, that the dream has a
significance. But they didn’t understand how to cut it. Or,
transference . . .

#### OLIVER COPE
Transference, yes.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Or, they’re so nice, they find an analyst. There’s a
joke, you know, about the analysts. A couch—The couch—
they have no idea what it is there for.

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes, the shrink. Couch refers particularly to the
analyst.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Cartoons. There’s the couch, there’s the patient,
there’s the analyst with a beard, a pad, and a certificate
on the wall over the patient. Now, first we don’t all have
beards. Second, we don’t put our certificate—and we don’t
have a pad. Only when we want to make a special note for
something, if we work on something, or young candidate in
trainings, writes down because they are afraid when they
come to their supervisors they have forgotten. However, the couch is no joke. It’s a relaxing thing which we want to introduce. We don’t want the patient to sit and look at us thewaywelookatour[ ] and then say what we think is acceptable and what isn’t. This is our whole, most important tool. We call it free association. That the patient relaxes, looks inward, and says what comes out. This is why the analyst sits behind him, so that he doesn’t scan his face; and the analyst can do what is his main obligation, to listen very carefully and not to try to control his expressions.

Now, this listening carefully means he doesn’t do
anything. I had a patient who came to me, and when he was
on the couch for the first time, he said, “Dr. Bibring, are
you one of those analysts where the patient detects after
two years that the doctor was dead two years ago already?”
So I said, “No. With me, you will find out after one year.”
[Laughs.]  And then we started a very fruitful analysis.

#### OLIVER COPE
I can see that this is an area where the other members
of the medical profession failed to grasp—of course,
they’re so used to being right in the middle of things, and
you’re trying to remove yourself as a personality. And any
troubles—because you’re not in the middle of it, you’re not trying to influence it. At what point do you decide to
try to influence your patient? Or do you never . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Oh yes. I don’t try to influence, I try to offer a
suggestion, what we call an interpretation. At the time
when we feel that the pattern has come close together, it
makes sense what he said last time and what he said in the
first hour and what he said today. And we feel we
understand something and the patient can understand [   ].
We don’t throw it at him just because we think it’s right.
If we are good analysts, you understand.

#### OLIVER COPE
Now, this is something that’s very hard for the
profession to get, because we expect when we talk to our
children that when we say, “Do it this way, now don’t do it
that way,; do it this way,” that that will straighten it
out.

#### MRS. BIBRING
That’s right.  But look here, there’s such a
difference in the overall technique of the medical person
and in the overall technique of the psychoanalyst. You
know, we keep things in abeyance. As I said, the first
thing and the present thing and his symptom all have to
stay there until we think we see the pattern. You doctors go whoooff, like that. You know?  This doesn’t belong, this
doesn’t belong, this doesn’t belong—you go as to what is
useful at this moment. This is this kind what some doctors
call their tunnel thinking, and we’re thinking this kind.

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, you brought up a very—I want to bring you to
another point, but you brought up something very important
about dreams, and I want to be sure I understand it
correctly. You saw the superficial aspects, where the dream
was and what you actually did may not be the real issue.
You said it was below. Now does that mean that there’s an
anxiety, or does that mean . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
It’s something—a censorship.

#### OLIVER COPE
A censorship did you say? Censorship imposed by a parent?

#### MRS. BIBRING
By life, by adjustment—you know, we all have our
ideas what we don’t want to wish or to feel or to think.

#### OLIVER COPE
And dreams give you—two or three or four dreams, one
after another, you may see a common denominator. Or is that
too quick?

#### MRS. BIBRING
It’s too quick. First of all, we have associations,
what we call free. We let the patient see what comes up
when he talks about his dream, with the idea that it leads
to the thing which he holds down. Now, in real life, day
life, we hold down much more than when we are asleep.

#### OLIVER COPE
Anybody who’s watched his dreams . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
Sure, they come up much more. But still camouflaged,
so that we try to get under it. Sometimes it comes
directly—quite simple things. I give you a dream a few
days ago—an anecdote. A person who hates his boss, and the
boss hates him. Hates his boss. He has a dream.  He’s a
very good man, by the way.  He has a dream where he sits at
the desk of his boss and the boss sits at the chair with a
pad and takes down what the patient says. And the patient
is [    ] the dream and they both laugh heartily and it’s
all in the greatest friendship. Now, you know he has
demoted that hated man but not quite to the point that he
didn’t take the sting out. It was all very funny, very
nice, you know. So one thing we did in the dream, we shift
around. Or can give you relationship between children,
parents.

#### OLIVER COPE
Now, you’ve given a little glimpse of what you drive
at in a dream—transference, which is another common thing.
What does it mean?

#### MRS. BIBRING
[Kluning?] calls it the psychoanalytic slang. People
use transference in a very odd way. For instance, they ask
someone who says he’s in analysis, “Have you already a
transference?” What do they mean? “Are you in love with
your analyst?” Transference means that and many more. You
can help your analyst lot of times, for instance. You can
suspect your analyst out of times, for instance. And I tell
you what it really means. We keep, as you know, very much
out, incognito. We don’t intrude our personality or point
of views into the thoughts of our patients.

#### OLIVER COPE
You try not to, but you do, don’t you?

#### MRS. BIBRING
Well, naturally, naturally.

#### OLIVER COPE
But you can’t help it.

#### MRS. BIBRING
No, but we can’t help, help it.  And there’s a
reality, too. However, we try not to disturb the transference, namely, a patient in this work with his
memories and his deep feelings somehow brings up old,
important relationships and depicts it in his relationship
to the analyst, who he doesn’t know, really, who permits
him to be bad, or wants to poison him—because that is what
comes up—this is transference. And it is extremely
manageable, because there he can see in reality feelings
which he has completely repressed and brushed aside since
childhood.

#### OLIVER COPE
Would you call-would you think of that patient you
talked about who hates his boss—is it proper to say he has
a negative transference to his boss?

#### MRS. BIBRING
Yes, too. You have to have transference all your life,
only it isn’t used and it isn’t as intense.

#### OLIVER COPE
And it is this kind of tense friendship . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
You transfer, you choose your life according to your
mother. You know, this is all transference. This is a
phenomenon which we reserve for a psychoanalytic
relationship which revives old ideas to this authority
figure.

#### OLIVER COPE
You’re not really to be limited to psychiatric
relationship.

#### MRS. BIBRING
We do . . .

#### OLIVER COPE
Otherwise you terminate, like in qualitative, like a
friendship. Or a dependence.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Well, I’ll tell you, whatever it is, it can be very
nice and cozy. Whatever, you know you are so influenced by
early experience. Positive and negative ones, you know? You
can have a brutal brother, and you are unable to speak up
in front of any strong male in later life. This is also
transference, only it’s not used, but when you make your
analyst, who is a nice woman, and start talking to a bully,
strong man, that is transference.

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes. I’d like to ask how much time we have. I have no
idea what time it is. I have in mind, because Dr. Bibring
wants to come at the end, to a very special question. And
I’ve not broached that area. Let’s keep right on going.
Well, now that would be better if we kept going. All right.
How do you explain—it relates to common, everyday things today—the difficulties and the worries that women have
about their rights and women’s rights, rights of
minorities? How do you yourself see the—how you became the
first woman clinical professor in the medical school. See,
well, I just feel that it’s—nobody can really see how that
happens, and yet it’s enormously important in a day when we
think we’ve got to struggle for everything. You have not
described to me as you were talking about your early days
in the outpatient in the Beth Israel and then having
seminars or house offices with some students, and then
Herman Blumguard, the professor of medicine, hearing about
you on his return from India after the war, and then
consulting you. You described something that just seemed to
be a natural. And yet, you’re a woman.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Look here, it’s very hard to know really, but I can
try analyst to boot.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Look here. I have been asked that many times, and it’s
very hard to really come down to what it is. I can give you
a few ideas I have. First of all, I think I take my job
What’s more, a psychiatrist! Who worked, and an
very seriously. And I don’t like gaps in my knowledge which
one could fill. And my husband and I, we had a joking but
very realistic statement when we didn’t understand
something in our field very well. We decided to get a
course on it. Number one, it’s very good, very helpful.
Number two, I always did my homework. I don’t slough off
things, really. I can’t live with myself when I’m sloppy in
that form. Number three, perhaps because I was a foreigner,
perhaps because I didn’t fit into anything quite, you
mustn’t disregard; perhaps you might, as a woman and as a
foreigner, and with everything, what the others are not.

#### OLIVER COPE
And when you came to the Beth Israel, there was no
other doctor who was in the field of psychoanalysis.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Yes, the whole outpatient clinic.

#### OLVIER COPE
So it wasn’t the fact that you were unique.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I don’t know how many there were, but quite a number
of these experienced Boston psychoanalysts, so we just
joined them. We were, I think, really senior to most of
them. Most of the people were our students, somehow,
somewhere, you know? However, they liked us, respected us,
they could learn from us, we could learn from them. So,
there were a number of them, really. Now, what else shall I
tell you that might have spoken in favor of it? IO think
there was one thing and I think it was a major thing. I
simply didn’t know that it isn’t done.

#### OLIVER COPE
You didn’t know, you didn’t put up a fight.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I didn’t notice it at the time.

#### OLIVER COPE
And you didn’t exhibit any undue aggressiveness.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I hope not.

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, I was thinking, maybe if you had “This I want”
and “This I’m up against”—well, I was conjecturing that
perhaps you were . . . [  ] and sets up barriers, and you
just . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
First of all, I don’t mind little disadvantages,
really, I’m not sensitive. Yes, but in very other fields.
For disrespect, yes; but for lack of knowledge, no.  And I
probably was quite flexible, and I just didn’t think of it.

#### OLIVER COPE
Would you be willing to give a little advice as a
result of this experience? For women who feel neglected and
unappreciated, and that chauvinist males . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
I’m very hesitant because I know here, coming from a
patriarchic environment in Vienna, I learned here about the
way women feel about their position and I do believe that
here things have gotten out of hand. Because I remember
when I had so many friends in the medical school, in the
institute, most of them were men. And something came to my
attention, very unpleasantly. We had many guests. They were
very interesting people and they were interested people and
we had discussions on everything. They came with their
wives. And all these women were college graduates, and
didn’t open their mouth. And I was the only woman, and I
was embarrassed because I was the hostess. At least there
was something in that family pattern which obviously never
came to my attention in my own home.

In Vienna, I was taken for granted, like another
student, and I never thought of it. I was a maverick,
probably.  Because when I went to medical school, there
were perhaps five women in medical school. I found it
delightful that there were so many men but in my seminar, the Harvard seminar, two young, intelligent women felt
worried because they went into medical school in a
Harvard/MIT combination, and there were 25 other students
or something like that and they were worried because there
were so few women to hold their hands. And I was delighted
that there were so few women in the medical school, because
everybody liked you and tried to do something. It didn’t
bother me. There’s something here, and I think it’s
advertisement. It’s the shampoo, it’s the stroking oneself
and being so lovely.

#### OLIVER COPE
Going way back to hysteria and the origins of the word
‘hysterical’, as a result of the experiences that force
them sometimes into hysterical positions—do women have
anything special to contribute to the field of psychiatry,
as compared to a man?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I tell you, it’s a quite interesting thing, because
what happened when the movement started, the liberation
movement, I had a number of urgent calls  and the people
wanted to talk to me but in my seminar, the Harvard
seminar, two young, intelligent women felt worried because
they went into medical school in a Harvard/MIT combination,
and there were 25 other students or something like that and they were worried because there were so few women to hold
their hands. And I was delighted that there were so few
women in the medical school, because everybody liked you
and tried to do something. It didn’t bother me. There’s
something here, and I think it’s advertisement. It’s the
shampoo, it’s the stroking oneself and being so lovely.

#### OLIVER COPE
Going way back to hysteria and the origins of the word
‘hysterical’, as a result of the experiences that force
them sometimes into hysterical positions, do women have
anything special to contribute to the field of psychiatry
as compared to a man?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I tell you, it’s a quite interesting thing. Because
what happened when the movement started, the liberation
movement, I had a number of urgent calls and the people who
wanted to talk to me were women, young women in the
liberation movement, and they came always armed with
Freud’s writing on women. Now, they ask me, “How could you
work with such a man?” I never thought of it! I mean, he
appreciated us, he made no distinction, but he had a
certain theory about women that they have a weaker
conscience (meaning Super Ego) on the basis of their
special anatomical difference, etc.  I don’t want to go into all that. I just tell you that he saw women of the
turn of the century. Deeply repressed, deeply frustrated,
playful, nothing to do. Even my patients were already
completely different. And he collaged a theory about what
he thought he saw.  He always used clinical observations to
form a theory. He gave it up when he found that he was
wrong. And later on, with the new lectures, etc., he said,
“Probably I don’t understand women.” Or the specific. And
it might need women analysts to help us out. Now, I don’t
think it needs women analysts if that were the case. I
wouldn’t understand men patients either., This is not
really necessary, if you are a free person, if you can look
at things, listen carefully, and appreciate what the
patient tells you.
#### OLIVER COPE
That brings us into a whole of—obviously there are
physical differences in the way man and woman has
biologically is different, but you’re saying there’s no
reason why a man couldn’t understand the full concepts of a
woman, understand what the biologic differences might
produce in the way of different thinking. That isn’t quite
fair, not thinking, I mean concepts and the same way that
the woman, there’s no inhibition to her intellectual power
to understand man’s thinking.

#### MRS. BIBRING
No, I think here to put two things now together. I
don’t know, do you talk about theory about women? Or do you
talk now about Madam Mark, and I don’t think it has to be a
woman to understand the woman. Because I could communicate
with any man what I think, a specific female, or that women
can tell it to you, and if you are a person who can listen,
you will understand it. Otherwise, I wouldn’t understand
you, either. Because you are a man, you have different
needs, I’m fully aware of the difference we need.

#### OLIVER COPE
What I’m puzzled over, is how the tradition, the
thinking of man and woman, are different. How that has come
into being and how one, if it’s wrong, how can one go about
dispelling it? It’s giving us trouble now.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Ah, you touch on something very complicated. I tell
you why. There are differences in the emotional reaction
but if I get into that now, I can just highlight it. I do
believe women usually are closer to childhood, to emotions
because their whole biological function somehow directs
them that way and certain things in a woman might be very
influenced by these little yet-unproduced caretaking, if I make myself understood and clear. There’s a tendency in
women to foster this.

You know, for instance, I have observed that women—
this is all very forbidden as far as liberation is
concerned—I have observed that women who had some
training, then got married, gave up their work, had
children, and didn’t find the need for something. Very
often they are in community service, schools, art.  You
understand? Perhaps somehow they apply. I don’t say there
is a mother instinct, I don’t believe that, but something
in a woman which is inclined and doesn’t shut it off—
perhaps you may try not to just be soft, perhaps you could
also go into community service (and they do it now more, by
the way).

#### OLIVER COPE
Modern society, present-day society hasn’t placed man
quite in that same position. He doesn’t have to give up for
the bearing of children.

#### MRS. BIBRING
It’s not only culture, really. It’s also biologically.

#### OLIVER COPE
As an ordinary doctor, I have a feeling that this
biological difference exists. It has to exist, and it’s one
of the reasons for knowing that you women have a brain, which in one sense at least is more complex than men’s.
It’s more complex and the brain runs the body, yes. The
brain runs our intestinal tract, it runs our breathing. All
right, the brain is more complicated and the intelligence
therefore has more places, the emotional balance has more
places to disturb the body. So your equilibrium, one could
say in a way, is more vulnerable, or more sensitive.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I think so. I think our bodies are stronger than
yours.

#### OLIVER COPE.
Well, I wouldn’t—stronger means muscular strength. You say
that its equilibrium is more solid, it’s less easily
disturbed.

#### MRS. BIBRING
More strength, also because of our biology.

#### OLIVER COPE
Maybe. But I’m trying to-I hadn’t thought of it that
way. You mean, you can starve for longer than man.

#### MRS. BIBRING
No, but I think you can get ill, can tolerate it
better.

#### OLIVER COPE
Your equilibrium is less readily discombobulated. And
strength in that sense, I wouldn’t disagree with that.
Although I’m . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
 Offended . . . but you don’t disagree.

#### OLIVER COPE
But clearly, our obligations and our senses of
responsibility are touched differently. Our sense of
responsibility, let’s say, toward marriage—man and woman
has a different concept of it, must have a little.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Can I tell you what one of my students said? Somebody
asked in my seminar, “Why do men really marry?” So, one of
the students said, “Because they want a housekeeper who
stays put.”  Ha ha. Well?

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, yes, we’re very selfish. And many of them want
somebody to make their economy stable and secure because
it’s a way of avoiding anxiety. And the children. So, I
don’t think we’re so . . . we understand each other on that
point.

#### MRS. BIBRING
I think now we really do interest too, what we are
saying. We can’t say it all, it opens up so many things
like culture versus biology, and you know, we pick and
nick, and I say things which are not quite right. So I
really think we have to be a little bit more definite about
it.  . . . children, and their whole emotional tendencies.

#### OLIVER COPE
Here we could spend the whole hour on children. I have
a very sort of simple idea about how—I was brought up on a
farm and I thought that was particularly good because I
sort of richly experienced without-and perhaps I judge
human beings in animal terms a little bit, but there is a
set of animal instincts and friendships and growing up, I
have patterns which resemble—the friendships the children
grow up in, resemble animal patterns. For example, boys in
their early adolescence at the time of puberty don’t want
anything to do with the girls. They’re all for the boys and
they . . . and then there’s this sudden sort of a change as
adolescence proceeds.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Girls don’t want to have anything to do with boys.

#### OLIVER COPE
All right. They don’t.  And this is referred to often
among girls as crushes, girls who are interested in older,
slightly older girls. Isn’t this a natural pattern? Isn’t
this a pattern one sees in animals, really? And now
currently we’re so worried about this sort of thing, and
homosexual tendencies and friendships that seem to go a
little bit beyond what are considered reasonable—
friendships among boys that go on overly long, parents get
worried or friends get worried that there’s a latent
homosexual tendency among them. And the same thing is true
with girls. But this is, basically, this is friendship, the
nee for—am I right? This is a need that animals have.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Friendship.  You make a difference between friendship
and sexuality, as if it were really things of a completely
different breed. Difference is the great misunderstanding
of Freud that when he talks about the biological foundation
and the drives—and the sex drive is one of the most
important things—shaping our adjustment, he talks not just
about pure sex and intercourse, he talks about all the
derivatives of this love. But it’s one nature. This all he
compromises in his concept of love and sex. So you can’t
say it isn’t sex, it is sublimated and it is a new directed
type but there is something underneath this need for another closeness for people. We just call it all part of
the primitive, lowdown sexual drive, and this is what
people misunderstand. And they think we have sexists, and
we are preoccupied with just constantly sex.

#### OLIVER COPE
Is the word ‘friendship’ interdependent be an adequate
alternative? Friendship between brothers is not adequate,
friendship between brother and sister.

#### MRS. BIBRING
But you know, it’s a derivative of this very primitive
deep down drive. What’s wrong with it?

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, the only thing wrong is that the word ‘sex’
either makes people recoil, or they are excessively
interested and wonder what’s coming next. It puts us off,
let’s say.  It puts us on our guard, it makes it very
difficult. Perhaps the modern generation is very much
better off in being able to talk about it. I’m not sure
that they understand it any better. And I’m not sure that
they’re dealing with it any better. However, maybe . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
It’s all very complicated. This is a theoretical
concept I just mentioned that through this primitive ape
that is in humans and in animals and in everything that lives and procreates, a number of important threads and
branches which all have to do with erotic and friendship.
You know, it’s still the same, ape down. Like, for
instance, aggression. Aggression is a deep animal instinct,
and you find it hidden when somebody wants to have a
promotion in his career. He wants the same claw that goes
in all directions.

#### OLIVER COPE
And the appreciation of beauty. I mean, is that the
same? Because they still think of pornography when we talk about
the sex drive.

#### OLIVER COPE
And the love of beauty or the appreciation of a very
beautiful painting, can be misinterpreted.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Sure, sure.  So you understand, this is what I say,
they knew about psychoanalytic concept but they don’t
understand them really. All of them seem to talk about
nothing but sex. I can assure you that there can be half a
year without ever touching on it, on its direct, simple
form., We talk about attachment, we talk about all kinds of things.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Yeah, you understand this is frightening to people. Homosexuality, for instance.  It is Freud who
says, like a good anatomist, that we are bisexual.

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes, very clear. And perhaps it’s the most telling
argument that in essence we’re both, but we’re
predominately one or the other. And hard, very hard for a
lot of people to deal with. And medical.

#### MRS. BIBRING
More than that. You know, now they try to say
homosexuality is normal, which is the other extreme. There
is a homosexuality that is built in, and they are very
neurotic homosexuals who are homosexuals because they are
afraid of the woman.

#### OLIVER COPE
Looking at my upbringing in the farm, I had no other
reaction than it is inadequacy, it’s stopping, it’s resting
life at an incomplete, immature level. In maturity, a
person of sex evolves fully, yet retaining that piece of
the other sex, both physically and in an understanding and
an affection for people of their own sex, but something
very hard for all of us, though, to deal with. It’s very
hard for men. I wonder if it’s as hard for women, too. It’s
hard for grown men, established men to recognize a really deep affection for another man. Am I right on that? And yet
it’s a very natural thing. Is that also true in women?

#### MRS. BIBRING
I don’t think so.  I don’t think quite so. You know,
the beauty of all this psychoanalysis is that there is
nothing that can be said for everybody. Everything is
different and we are used to try to find out where the
difference is. However, a little bit in general I can say,
you know, a boy grows up with an attachment to his mother.
And shifts, transfers it to the girls and to the women.
When this attachment is disturbed to such a point that he
has to avoid women, that is a much more deep-rooted problem
for him, because it breaks, so to speak, his—let us call
it—‘normal’ development.

A girl is attached to mother, too, and can stay
attached and can turn into a homosexual and doesn’t feel
that this is something which makes her a freak. A boy
usually feels it makes him a sissy, that something is very
wrong. So they are very often more frightened by
discovering these tendencies.

#### OLIVER COPE
A boy’s homosexual tendency then doesn’t derive from
an unusually strong love of the father.

#### MRS. BIBRING
That is what I mean. It can be an unusually strong
love, it can be an unusually strong fear of the father and
a submissiveness to father. It can come from an unusually
strong conflict with mother, so that one turns to father
for compensation. It has then enough possibilities.

#### OLIVER COPE
Yes, you’ve just given an excellent example of the
multiple factors involved in anything. As a matter of fact,
all could operate in the same time in a kind of confusion,
and it may be very difficult for you as an analyst to
identify in a patient.

#### MRS. BIBRING
Well, you have to wait and to listen.

#### OLIVER COPE
And it isn’t subject to a decision, well “You are
this, and therefore you are bad.” Or, “You’re off the
beam.”

Well, they wanted that done. And I don’t know whether
they have something else you want done. Is there something
else you want talked over? Because I think you covered that
beautifully. Talk informally . . .

#### MRS. BIBRING
We chatted for the last fifteen minutes, I think,
responsibly.

#### OLIVER COPE
Well, we have a picture of two types of psychiatrists
and this is the basically difficult thing for the
profession. One is the straight-line psychiatrist that I
see as the person who tries to make a quick analysis, if
you would. It has to be an analysis or else the patient is
in trouble. And then tell the patient, “Look, you’re just
doing this and if you just turn around and look over there,
then you’ll do better.”

#### MRS. BIBRING
Nobody says ‘naïve’ anymore. Not in that simple form.
But there are a few psychiatrists in this country who are
not touched by psychoanalysis in one way or another. They
are the main users of psychoanalytic concepts if they
understand and can apply it.  But you know, there is now in
the population a trend away from psychoanalysis. It’s an
anti-intellectual trend and analysis before was mysterious,
because of symbols and dreams. Now it’s too intellectual,
and the younger generation goes towards mysterious
experiences, gurus, astrologers, the primal scream, the
touch, sensitivity group, with the hope to cleanse themselves of those by an emotional discharge. So they are
now against analysis because we are too rational.

#### OLIVER COPE
Sessions take too long. It takes more than that year.
And the guru, on the other hand, if you devote five, six
weeks . . .
