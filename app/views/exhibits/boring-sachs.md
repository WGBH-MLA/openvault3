## intro

In his book A history of psychology in autobiography, Dr. Boring admits that in 
1933,at the suggestion of his friends and family, he began psychoanalysis 
treatment with a former colleague of Freud, Hans Sachs. Boring remained in 
psychoanalysis for a year, doing 5 sessions a week, but he found it to be 
ineffective in alleviating his concerns. Boring had hoped to achieve a change 
in personality by the end of this experience and was disappointed to find that 
he still had his old mindset. Four years later, both Sachs and Boring wrote 
about the experience in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. The two 
men agreed that the psychoanalysis was not successful. Coincidently, the Boston 
Psychoanalytic Society and Institute bears Hanns Sach's name for its library 
and archives. While the bulk of Hanns Sach's papers did not get preserved and 
perished in the home of George Wilbur after his death, BPSI holds his legacy, 
two audio interviews with people who knew him well, his biographical materials, 
and his endowment entrusted to the library by Sach's lawyer and benefactor, 
David R. Pokross.
