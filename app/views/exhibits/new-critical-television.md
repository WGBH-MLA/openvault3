## intro

I. A. Richards’s Sense of Poetry (October-December 1957) and its sequel Wrath 
of Achilles (January-March 1958) added poetry appreciation to the diverse 
televised lectures broadcast by WGBH-TV in its first years on the air. Harvard 
professor Richards was an interesting choice. He ranks among the most prominent 
twentieth-century literary critics. Generally credited with pioneering the 
approach known as New Criticism, he also helped develop the Basic English 
approach to language education. Richards denounced mass media as culturally 
debasing throughout his career. Despite this, he was also a prominent advocate 
for educational television. Before Sense, he collaborated with Christine Gibson 
and M. H. Ilsey to produce French Through Television, which was the surprise 
hit of 1956, WGBH-TV’s first year on the air. Sense and Wrath aired Thursday 
evenings at 8:30 pm, against NBCs Dragnet. Both shows were kinescoped to allow 
recirculation on the fledgling National Education Television network (ancestor 
to PBS). In its promotional material for Sense of Poetry, NET touted Richards’s 
“background and insight” as well as his “dramatic flair.” It remains unclear, 
however, whether Richards’s programs aired outside Boston. WGBH’s Lewis Barlow 
produced both series.
