## intro

From 1972 through 1978, WGBH produced one of the nation’s most celebrated and 
best-loved children’s television shows, ZOOM. Aimed at an audience of children 
from about seven to twelve years of age, ZOOM reached millions through the 
expanding national public television network of the 1970s. ZOOM’s conceit was 
that it was a show created by children, for children: young viewers sent in the 
ideas for its content, while ordinary children from the Boston area served as 
its cast members. Perhaps two million viewers wrote in to ZOOM to offer advice 
and ideas or to ask for information about the show, and ZOOM showcased a wide 
range of their experiences and ideas. In truth, the adults who created ZOOM had 
much more of a role in selecting and shaping the material that went into the 
show than they let on. However, ZOOM reflected the goals of a new generation of 
producers of children’s programming in the 1970s: to empower young people and 
to reflect more fully the diversity of American children’s experiences.
