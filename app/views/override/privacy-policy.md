vendors (collectively “we”) acting on our behalf to help deliver the services 
and operate and analyze use of the Site collect, what we do with the

## 1.  WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?
    
We collect two types of information from you: a) Personally identifiable 
information, which includes personal information (such as your name, address, 
e-mail address, telephone number, credit card information and/or other 
identifying information) you voluntarily supply upon request when you register 
for our website, make a donation, complete a survey, register for an online 
discussion, enter a contest, or provide your e-mail address;  and b) 
Non-personally identifiable information, for example IP Addresses and cookies, 
which include tracking information collected as you navigate through our site. 
Uses of this information are discussed in Section 2 below.

### A.  Personally Identifiable Information
    
We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other 
than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis upon request.
    
#### Registration for our website:</em><br>

Anyone can view our site, however some pages of the Site may require a 
free registration which enables full access to the information and resources 
offered throughout the Site.  A unique email address (user name) and password 
must be supplied to register. By using the Site, you are agreeing to the 
conditions of our Terms of Use.
    
#### Support of Open Vault and the WGBH Media Library and Archives:<br>

On certain pages within the Site we may now or in the future offer 
visitors the opportunity to make a donation in support ofthe Open Vault website 
and the WGBH Media Library and Archives.  If a visitor chooses to make a

billing address and credit card information.
    
#### Content Submissions:</em><br>

On certain pages within the Site you can submit content to be published, 
such as tags, annotations, and comments.  We may collect your name, address,

which information is required and which is optional. We may contact users 
regarding their submissions in certain circumstances.
    
#### Your submission of others’ Personally Identifiable Information:

On certain pages within the Site you can submit information about other 
people.  For example, you may submit a person’s name and email address to send 
an article. This information will only be used for your intended purpose.
    
#### E-Mail and E-Mail Newsletters:

On occasion, we may collect personal information from users in connection 
with optional  emails and e-mail newsletters. We will indicate which

### B.  Non-personally Identifiable Information
    
In addition to information that you provide to us, we (again, this is 
WGBH and our affiliates and third party vendors) may also collect and store 
certain non-personally identifiable information automatically when you use the 
Site.  This information helps us improve the experience you and other visitors 
have with the Site.
    
For example, we may collect your IP address, browser information and 
reference site domain, as well as related information such as the date on which 
you visit the Site.   This information does not identify you personally and is 
only used in the aggregate.
    
As is common practice among web sites, we use “cookies” and similar 
technologies.  In general, cookies &mdash; the informational files that your 
web browser places on your computer when you visit a website &mdash; are used 
on this Site to track and analyze how you and other visitors use our Site.  We 
use these cookies in order to improve the Site, to identify the source of 
visitors and what pages you use while on our site, to offer visitors 
interactive and/or personalized features that would not be possible without the 
cookies, to recall specific information to save visitors time when they return 
to the Site, to provide our sponsors targeted sponsorship opportunities, to 
provide visitors customized sponsorship messages or list of customized videos 
of interest, and to identify usage and statistical trends.  By looking at this 
traffic we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our 
Site and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service. Our 
sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship messages onto our site, 
and third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the Site for us, 
may also use their own cookies.  At no time does the cookie reveal your name, 
address, or e-mail address (even if you have entered these in specific areas of 
the Site). The Site pages cannot extract any personally identifying information 
about you from what we receive via a cookie and your browser.
    
You can set your browser preferences to refuse cookies or to alert you 
when cookies are being sent. However, some parts of the Site will not function 
properly if you do so.

## 2.  HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION GATHERED ON THE SITE?
    
Neither WGBH, nor our third-party vendors acting on our behalf to help 
deliver the services and operate the Site, will willfully disclose any 
personally identifiable information about our online users to any 
non-affiliated third party without first receiving the user’s permission, 
unless required by law. WGBH’s affiliates include our local and national 
productions (for example, NOVA, and Forum Network), PBS, and other public 
broadcasting stations or programming.
    
In terms of our own use of information, we may use your personally 
identifiable information for the activities described in the previous sections, 
for the activities described when you submitted the information, or for 
internal and marketing promotional purposes as further described in this 
policy.
    
We will typically explain the extent of use at the time you are asked to 
provide personal information.  If you do not want this information to be 
collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply “opt out.”  Under 
certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities 
for which personal information is needed, as in contests.
    
As mentioned, in certain cases, we contract with other companies to 
provide services on our behalf. These service providers maintain customer 
databases with e-mail addresses of Site visitors who have provided them to us 
by registering at our site, signing up for a newsletter or listserv, e-mailing 
us questions about the service, donors who submit online contributions, or 
online buyers who make a purchase. We (which includes our service providers) 
will use these addresses to respond to the general purposes for which we 
collected the information, to provide services and to operate the Site, 
including to respond to inquiries; to process credit card payments, billing, 
and shipping; to process e-mail distribution; for list processing and analysis; 
for promotions management; to send information about WGBH’s programs, services, 
or your local public broadcasting station’s membership/fundraising; or to 
correspond about a purchase or product offers. Our service providers have 
access to your personally identifiable information as necessary to provide 
certain services on our behalf. They are required to maintain the privacy of 
all such information in their possession or control and can only use the 
information on our behalf for the purpose that we have contracted them, for 
example sending you a newsletter. They are not authorized  to use your 
information for any other purpose.
    
Similarly, personally identifiable information provided in connection 
with a donation will be shared with third parties who perform services to 
process the donation.
    
We will not sell, exchange, or lend e-mail addresses to any 
non-affiliated third party without your permission. However, we or our service 
providers may release personally identifiable information if we believe in good 
faith that the law or legal process requires it, we have received a valid 
administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or such release is 
necessary to protect anyone’s rights, property or safety.
    
On certain pages, we may now or in the future, offer visitors the 
opportunity to provide comments, messages or other user-generated text, content 
or materials (collectively “User Materials”).  Any information that you 
disclose when posting a message to these areas, such as your name, screen name 
or ID used, becomes public.  In addition, the information that you disclose in 
these areas may be used by us for promotional and marketing purposes. We are 
not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to 
disclose in these public areas.  Further, WGBH, its production units, public 
broadcasting station affiliates and their licensees, may use, copy, sublicense, 
modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, 
index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information 
contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known 
or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the Site, public 
broadcasting station web sites, other third party web sites, over the air (on 
radio or television), and on mobile platforms.
    
We reserve the right to send you e-mail relating to your account status. 
This includes order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices of 
credit-card problems, other transactional e-mails and notifications about major 
changes to our Site and/or to our Privacy Policy.
    
WGBH, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service 
vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and 
better design the Site and to share with third parties in aggregate form only 
as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of 
users accessed a particular video on our Site. However, we will not disclose 
any information that could be used to identify those users.
    
## 3.  SECURITY OF INFORMATION
    
WGBH has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, 
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information 
we collect online. Credit card information provided on the Site is protected 
against unauthorized use by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features.  The 
SSL protocol is the industry standard method for creating an encrypted, secure 
connection between your web browser and a web server, such as the Site’s 
server. You should, however, keep in mind that no Internet or e-mail 
transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail is not 
encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send 
to us via e-mail.
    
## 4.  CHILDREN’S GUIDELINES
    
openvault.wgbh.org is a general audience site and does not knowingly 
collect or store personally identifiable information about children under the 
age of 13.
    
## 5.  CORRECTIONS TO PERSONAL DATA; OPTING OUT
    
Please <a target="_self" href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a> to a) correct 
or update any personal information in the WGBH database that you state is 
erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from WGBH, or c) request WGBH to 
make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from the WGBH 
online database, thereby canceling your profile, newsletter registration and 
other WGBH registrations. This will not necessarily remove previous public 
comments and other User Materials submitted for public display on the Site. You 
should understand that it may be impossible to delete personal information 
entirely because of backups and records of deletions.
