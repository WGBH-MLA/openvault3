The [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://www.americanarchive.org) is a collaboration between WGBH and the Library of Congress to preserve and make accessible significant historical content created by public television and radio, and to coordinate a national effort to preserve at-risk public broadcasting before its content is lost to posterity. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) funded the digitization of 40,000 hours of historic public television and radio content contributed by more than 100 stations across the country. CPB also provided a two year grant to WGBH and the Library of Congress as the permanent stewards of the collection.
