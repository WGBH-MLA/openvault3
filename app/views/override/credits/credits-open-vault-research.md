Funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the WGBH Media Library & 
Archives Digital Library Project has completed three phases. In the first phase, 
WGBH conducted an assessment of the value of our archival collections for 
scholarly use. In the second phase, “Developing a Public Television Content 
Delivery System for Academic Institutions,” WGBH developed Open Vault Research. 
 Designed in close collaboration with scholars, this  prototype web site 
facilitates research access to the collections. Further, working with Ithaka 
S+R, we investigated the sustainability of online archives for academic use. 
Beyond Open Vault Research, lessons from both Phase One and Phase Two of the 
Digital Library Project also informed the design and development of Open Vault 
Vietnam. In the third phase, we explored the best methods for bringing our catalog online for scholarly and public access and helped drive new interest and scholarly work around our resources.
