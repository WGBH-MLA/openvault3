The creation of Open Vault: WGBH Media Library and Archives Web site was 
made possible through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services 
(IMLS). Any views, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this

The prototype website was funded in part by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation.
