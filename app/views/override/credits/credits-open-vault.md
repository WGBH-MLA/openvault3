The creation of Open Vault: WGBH Media Library and Archives Web site was 
made possible in part by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)](http://www.imls.gov) (IMLS Grant Log Number [LG-05-05-0220-05](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-05-05-0220-05)). Any views, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this website do not necessarily represent those of the IMLS.

The prototype website was funded in part by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation.

IMLS further funded the development of Open Vault in 2008 by supporting the [Vietnam Collection](/collections/vietnam/interviews).
