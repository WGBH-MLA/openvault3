# Open Vault Credits

The creation of **Open Vault** was made possible 
through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The views, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this website do not necessarily represent those of the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

The prototype website was funded in part by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation.

This site brings together materials from three previous web sites:
    
- [New Television Workshop](/collections/ntw-the-new-television-workshop)
- [Say Brother](/collections/sbro-say-brother)
- [Ten O’Clock News](/collections/tocn-the-ten-o-clock-news) 

As well as new material from [War and Peace in the Nuclear Age](/collections/wpna-wpna-war-and-peace-in-the-nuclear-age).

IMLS further funded the development of Open Vault in 2008 by supporting the [Vietnam Collection](/collections/vietnam-the-vietnam-collection/interviews).

Subsequent funding by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation helped inform the later design and additional functionality of Open Vault, as well as the [scholar exhibits](/exhibits).
