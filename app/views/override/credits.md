The prototype website was funded in part by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation.

This site brings together materials from three previous web sites
    
- [New Television Workshop](/collections/ntw-the-new-television-workshop)
- [Say Brother](/collections/sbro-say-brother)
- [Ten O’Clock News](/collections/tocn-the-ten-o-clock-news) 

As well as new material from [War and Peace in the Nuclear Age](/collections/wpna-wpna-war-and-peace-in-the-nuclear-age)

IMLS further funded the development of Open Vault in 2008 by supporting the [Vietnam Collection](/collections/vietnam-the-vietnam-collection/interviews).

Subsequent funding by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation helped inform the later design and additional functionality of Open Vault, as well as the [scholar exhibits](/exhibits).
