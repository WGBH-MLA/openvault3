The initial creation of **Open Vault** was made possible in part by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)](http://www.imls.gov) (IMLS Grant Log Number [LG-05-05-0220-05](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-05-05-0220-05)). IMLS further funded the development of Open Vault in 2008 by supporting the Vietnam Collection.

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation supported the further development of Open Vault through the [Digital Library Initiative](/credits/credits-open-vault-research), funding the addition of new functionality and features such as a catalog, scholar exhibits, and digitization on demand.
