The prototype website was funded in part by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation.

The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) further funded the development 
of Open Vault in 2008, with the addition of the Vietnam Collection. Subsequent 
lessons learned from Open Vault Research, funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, 
helped inform the later design and functionality of Open Vault Vietnam.
