// Inspired by https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/maintain-aspect-ratio-
// mixin/ but removed use of pseudo element because I don't think it is needed
// to get the desired effect. See below for examples of usage within markup.

@mixin aspect-ratio($width, $height) {
  position: relative;

  // When padding is a %, it's calculated as a % of the width of the
  // containing box. This is how the ratio is maintained.
  padding-bottom: 100% / ($width / $height);

  // Hide anything outside of the .content box. This can be parameterized in
  // the mixin if we need to turn it on/off.
  overflow: hidden;

  // For the contained content, we have an immediate child container that
  // stretches to it's parent. If you want style the *inside* of the content
  // within the aspec-ratio container, then apply those styles to the .content
  // element.
  > .aspect-ratio-content {
    // stretch the .content element to it's parent with positioning.
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
  }
}

//.aspect-ratio-16x9 {
//  @include aspect-ratio(16, 9);
//}

.aspect-ratio-4x3 {
  @include aspect-ratio(4, 3);
}


// Examples of usage within markup:
// 
// <div class="aspect-ratio-16x9">
//   <div class="aspect-ratio-content">
//     Content in here will maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio.
//   </div>
// </div>
