  <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Asset Description">David Jones was a general in the U.S. Air Force, who served in the Strategic
                    Air Command as an operations planner, then as General Curtis LeMay?s aide. He
                    went on to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1978-1982). In this
                    interview he discusses the Air Force?s policies and attitudes during the Kennedy
                    administration in the early 1960s. He explains the USAF?s unease with the young
                    civilian defense analysts, or ?whiz kids,? brought into the Pentagon at that
                    time. Of all of the changes made by Secretary of Defense McNamara, the
                    cancellation of the B-70 was what most upset SAC and the Air Force. He vouches
                    for the versatility and accuracy of the Air Force?s bombers, and reacts to the
                    cancellation of various bomber programs. He describes the change in strategic
                    doctrine away from mutually assured destruction and towards targeting Soviet
                    military sites. He argues that to support this doctrine the Air Force required
                    all of the missile capability it had requested, and calls the compromise of
                    1,000 Minuteman missiles rather than 3,000, a mistake. He believes that it was
                    the credible threat that the U.S. could destroy substantial Soviet military
                    capabilities, rather than the notion of mutually assured destruction, that gave
                    weight to Kennedy?s position during the Cuban Missile Crisis.</pbcoreDescription>
  <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Series Description">The first atomic explosion in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, changed
                    the world forever. This series chronicles these changes and the history of a new
                    era. It traces the development of nuclear weapons, the evolution of nuclear
                    strategy, and the politics of a world with the power to destroy itself. In
                    thirteen one-hour programs that combine historic footage and recent interviews
                    with key American, Soviet, and European participants, the nuclear age unfolds:
                    the origin and evolution of nuclear weapons; the people of the past who have
                    shaped the events of the present; the ideas and issues that political leaders,
                    scientists, and the public at large must confront, and the prospects for the
                    future. Nuclear Age highlights the profound changes in contemporary thinking
                    imposed by the advent of nuclear weapons. Series release date: 1/1989</pbcoreDescription>
  <pbcoreDescription descriptionType="Program Description">For the destructive power they deliver, nuclear weapons are cheap and
                    efficient. In the 1950’s the United States begins to rely on nuclear, rather
                    than conventional, weapons for its defense. As nuclear policy evolved during the
                    Eisenhower Administration, three factors combined to produce a new American
                    reliance on nuclear weapons: pressure to control the federal budget (the “bigger
                    bang” argument); competition as each branch of the American military adapted
                    nuclear weapons to its mission; and Soviet bluffs that fueled American fears
                    about a “bomber gap” and later a “missile gap.” On October 4, 1957, Sputnik, the
                    Soviet satellite that was the first to orbit Earth, shocked Americans and
                    delighted the Soviets. A month later, the Soviets launched Sputnik 2 with a dog
                    on board. Both the Soviets and the Americans knew that a booster capable of
                    carrying a dog into space could also deliver a nuclear warhead across a
                    continent in 30 minutes.</pbcoreDescription>
